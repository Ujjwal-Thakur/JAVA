//Java is a "typed" language, it means we need to type or specify the datatype when we declare a new variable.
//There are two types of data types in java: Primitive and Non-Primitive
//Primitive data types: int, char, long, float, double, byte, short,boolean
//Non-Primitive: String, Array, Class, Object, Interface

//Input:
//for taking input we need to import the package "java.util";
//and Scanner class is used to take input.

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Name: ");
String name = sc.next();                    //"next" function takes string as input; but only one token (1 token = 1 word);
System.out.println(name);

sc.nextLine();                             //Clear the newline character left by next();

System.out.print("Sentence: ");
String sentence = sc.nextLine();           //"nextLine" function is used to take full length string as input.
System.out.println(sentence);

System.out.print("x: ");
int x = sc.nextInt();                      //"nextInt" is used for taking integer as input;
System.out.print("y: ");
int y = sc.nextInt();
int sum = x+y;
System.out.println("the sum of "+ x + " and "+ y +" is: "+sum);
sc.close();                                              // Close the scanner to release resources

//  Similarily "nextLong" is used to take long as input and "nextDouble" is used to take double as input...

//for taking char as input :
char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);    //here  charAt is used to take char at index 0 as input;
